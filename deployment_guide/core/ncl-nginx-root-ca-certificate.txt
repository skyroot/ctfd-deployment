To create SSL certificate and configure nginx for HTTPS connection:

1. SSH into the server VM (ctfd@172.18.178.40)

2. Generate rootCA key and certificate:
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 3650 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /opt/nginx-ssl-certs/rootCA.key -out /opt/nginx-ssl-certs/rootCA.crt

with the details in order:
	SG, Singapore, Singapore, National Cybersecurity R&D Laboratory, ., NCL Root Certificate Authority, support@ncl.sg

3. Create end-entity certificate key:
sudo openssl genrsa -out /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key 2048

4. Create signing request:
sudo openssl req -new -key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key -out ncl-sg.csr

with the details in order:
	SG, Singapore, Singapore, National Cybersecurity R&D Laboratory, NCL CTF, *.ctf.ncl.sg, support@ncl.sg

5. Create a file "san.txt" with the content:
subjectAltName=DNS:*.ctf.ncl.sg

6. Generate the signed end-entity certificate:
sudo openssl x509 -req -extfile san.txt -in ncl-sg.csr -CA /opt/nginx-ssl-certs/rootCA.crt -CAkey /opt/nginx-ssl-certs/rootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt -days 3650 -sha256

7. Replace the contents of rootCA.crt and rootCA.pem in ctfd-deployment folder with the contents in your newly generated rootCA.crt.

8. Create Diffie-Hellman group for Forward Secrecy:
sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem 2048

9. Follow step 2 onwards in https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-nginx-in-ubuntu-16-04



For clients:

Install rootCA.crt into their web browsers as a Certificate Authority.
CTFd server will send SSL certificates signed by this rootCA.
